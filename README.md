# 💭 Ruby Capstone Project Telegram BOT

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

This project consists of creating a telegram Bot that does some simple things.

## 🔮 The Project Brief

The project was created according to the requirements of the Capstone project.
- A bot developed in Ruby
- Recommended platforms: [Slack](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot), [Twitter](https://github.com/muffinista/chatterbot), [Telegram](https://github.com/atipugin/telegram-bot-ruby)
- You choose the platform and the functionality of the bot
- The README must include instructions on how to use the bot (how to install it and use it)

## Requirements

This bot requires the following gems:
  -Telegram BOT
  -Bundle
It also requires ypou to have a telegram account.

## 🔨 Installation and execution.

  -Clone the folder using the following line on you terminal: git clone https://github.com/queeksm/Microverse-Ruby-Capstone.git
  
  -Install the gems with the following commands: $ gem install telegram-bot-ruby
  
  -Execute the bot that's within the bin folder: ruby bot.rb
  
  -Talk to t.me/inv3rt3r_bot on Telegram and /start.

Commands:
  -/Attack to attack the enemy
  
  -/Weaken to weaken the enemy
  
  -/Heal to heal yourself (Heal consumes 10 MP, so you can only heal 8 times)
  
  -/Status to remove the weakened status and check both your and your enemy HP and MP
  
  -/Forfeit to surrender.
  
  -/InstaG1BN4O instantly kills the inverter (Test purposes only)

Once you or the Inverter dies, the bot resets both your and the Inverter health and MP
